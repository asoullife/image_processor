├── 1/
│   ├── image_001.jpg (up to 200 images)
│   └── ...
├── 2/
│   ├── image_201.jpg (next 200 images)
│   └── ...
└── reports/
    ├── processing_report_[session_id].xlsx
    └── dashboard_[session_id].html
```

## Technical Fixes Implemented

### 1. SQLiteProgressTracker Enhancements
```python
# Added missing methods for main application compatibility
def save_image_result(self, result: ProcessingResult) -> bool
def update_session_progress(self, session_id: str, processed_count: int, 
                           approved_count: int, rejected_count: int) -> bool
def get_session_results(self, session_id: str) -> List[ProcessingResult]
```

### 2. FileManager Configuration Fix
```python
# Fixed initialization to use correct configuration parameter
self.file_manager = FileManager(self.config_dict['output']['images_per_folder'])
```

### 3. Report Generation Interface Compatibility
```python
# Updated report generation calls to match expected interface
report_path = self.report_generator.generate_excel_report(
    session_id=session_id,
    processing_results=results,
    decision_results=decision_results,
    aggregated_results=aggregated_results,
    output_dir=output_folder
)
```

### 4. Data Structure Conversion
- Implemented proper conversion between database dictionaries and ProcessingResult objects
- Added compatibility layer for DecisionResult and AggregatedResults creation
