# Robust Resume and Recovery System Implementation

## Overview

The robust resume and recovery system has been successfully implemented to handle session interruptions and provide multiple recovery options for the Adobe Stock Image Processor. This system ensures that processing can continue from the exact point of interruption, minimizing data loss and user frustration.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Checkpoint System
- **Automatic checkpoints every 10 processed images** (configurable)
- **Multiple checkpoint types**: Image, Batch, Milestone, Emergency, Manual
- **Complete session state persistence** including:
  - Current batch and image index
  - Processing counters (processed, approved, rejected)
  - Memory and GPU usage metrics
  - Processing rate and performance data
  - Error tracking and last error message
  - Processing configuration snapshot

### 2. Multiple Resume Options
- **Continue from checkpoint**: Resume from the exact last processed image
- **Restart current batch**: Restart from the beginning of the current batch
- **Fresh start**: Start completely from the beginning (with user confirmation)

### 3. Crash Detection and Recovery
- **Automatic crash detection on startup** based on:
  - Session update timestamps
  - Error messages and patterns
  - System resource usage patterns
- **Crash type classification**:
  - Power failure
  - System crash
  - Application crash
  - Out of memory
  - Network failure
- **Recovery confidence scoring** based on checkpoint age and integrity

### 4. Data Integrity Verification
- **Checkpoint integrity verification** using SHA-256 hashing
- **Database consistency checks** after recovery
- **Duplicate detection and cleanup**
- **Counter validation** (processed vs actual database records)
- **Safe-to-continue assessment**

### 5. Session State Persistence
- **Complete session state serialization** to JSON
- **Atomic checkpoint operations** to prevent corruption
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed recovery attempts
- **Session isolation** for concurrent processing

## Database Schema

### Checkpoints Table

CREATE TABLE checkpoints (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES processing_sessions(id),
    checkpoint_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    processed_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    current_batch INTEGER,
    current_image_index INTEGER,
    session_state JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Recovery Operations
- `GET /api/recovery/crashed-sessions` - Detect crashed sessions
- `GET /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/recovery-options` - Get recovery options
- `POST /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/recover` - Execute recovery
- `POST /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/resume` - Resume session

### Checkpoint Management
- `GET /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/checkpoints` - List checkpoints
- `GET /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/latest-checkpoint` - Get latest checkpoint
- `POST /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/checkpoint` - Create manual checkpoint
- `DELETE /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/checkpoints` - Cleanup old checkpoints

### Integrity and Monitoring
- `POST /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/verify-integrity` - Verify data integrity
- `POST /api/recovery/sessions/{id}/emergency-checkpoint` - Emergency checkpoint

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Recovery on Startup
```python
# In startup sequence
crashed_sessions = await recovery_service.detect_crashes_on_startup()
for session_info in crashed_sessions:
    if session_info["can_recover"]:
        recovery_options = await recovery_service.prepare_recovery_options(
            session_info["session_id"]
        )
        # Present options to user or auto-recover
```

### Manual Checkpoint Creation
```python
checkpoint_data = await checkpoint_manager.create_session_checkpoint(
    session_id=session_id,
    checkpoint_type=CheckpointType.MANUAL,
    force=True
)
```

### Recovery Execution
```python
success, message, start_index = await recovery_service.execute_recovery(
    session_id=session_id,
    recovery_option="continue",
    user_confirmed=True
)
```

### Frontend Recovery Dialog
```typescript
const { crashedSessions, executeRecovery } = useRecovery();

// Show recovery dialog for crashed session
<RecoveryDialog
  open={recoveryDialogOpen}
  crashedSession={selectedSession}
  onRecoveryComplete={handleRecoveryComplete}
/>
```

## Configuration

### Checkpoint Interval
```python
# In config
checkpoint_interval = 10  # Create checkpoint every 10 images
```

### Recovery Timeout
```python
# Consider session crashed after 5 minutes of inactivity
crash_detection_timeout = timedelta(minutes=5)
```

### Checkpoint Retention
```python
# Keep only 5 most recent checkpoints per session
keep_count = 5
```

## Error Handling

### Emergency Checkpoints
- Created automatically when errors occur during processing
- Include error message and context
- Mark session as failed but recoverable
- Enable recovery from point of failure
